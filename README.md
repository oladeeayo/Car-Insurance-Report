## Data Cleaning

A few of the dataset was cleaned for better representation, the birthrate column was converted from (mm/dd/yyyy) to (dd/mm/yyyy) to allow proper representation of the claimant's birthdate.

Also, a new column called age and age range was created to know the current claimant's age and sub-represented in age range categories like 20 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69, and 70 -79
