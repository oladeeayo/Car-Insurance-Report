## Data Cleaning

A few of the dataset was cleaned for better representation, the birthrate column was converted from (mm/dd/yyyy) to (dd/mm/yyyy) to allow proper representation of the claimant's birthdate.

Also, a new column called age and age range was created to know the current claimant's age and sub-represented in age range categories like 20 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69, and 70 -79

## Summary

- The total number of insurance claimants is 37,542.
- The average claims amount is $50,028.21.
- The average household income is $147,247.41.
- From the data visuals, we can see that Ford, Chevrolet, and Dodge brands are the car brands with the most claims frequency and amount claimed.
- Aquamarine, Indigo, and Green are the car colors with the highest claims frequency.
- We have close distributions of male and female claims frequency each starting at 49.51% and 50.49% respectively.
- The age range '70 - 79' has the least claims frequency among the ages.
- Cars made in 1950 have the highest claimed amount.

## Recommendation

- More education and incentive packages should be created to attract more commercial car users, this is because of the wide gap between commercial car users and private car users.
- Create targeted insurance packages to fit clients in the 70 - 79 age range as they have the lowest claims count in the age bracket.
